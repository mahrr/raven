# The clock struck midnight

#- #-
	And through my sleeping
	I heard a tapping at my door
	I looked but nothing lay in the darkness
	And so I turned inside once more
	To my amazement
	There stood a raven
	Whose shadow hung above my door
	Then through the darkness
	It spoke that one word
	That I shall hear forever more
	Nevermore
	Thus quoth the raven, nevermore
	And still the raven remains in my room
	No matter how much I implore
	No words can soothe him
	No prayer remove him
	And I must hear for evermore
	Quoth the raven, nevermore
	Thus quoth the raven
	Nevermore
